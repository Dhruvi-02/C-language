- A looping statement also known as an iterative statement allows a script to repeatedly perform a task or set of tasks until a specified condition is met. Looping statements are useful when a series of tasks need to be performed on each member of a set.

The main segments of loop are:
- Initialization: This step is executed once at the beginning of the loop to declare and initialize any loop control variables.
- Condition: This step is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed and if it is false the loop terminates.
- Update: This step is executed after each iteration and is typically used to update loop control variables.

Looping Statements are of two types:
- Entry Controlled loop: Test condition is checked first and loop body will be executed. If test condition is false, loop body will not be executed. Examples: for loop and while loop

- Exit Controlled loop: Loop body will be executed first and then condition is checked. If test condition is false, loop body will be executed once. Examples: do while loop
