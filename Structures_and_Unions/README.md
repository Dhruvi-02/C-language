# This folder contains codes of Structures of C Programming Language

- We cannot use an array if we want to represent a collection of data items of different types using a single name. C supports a constructed data type known as structures, a mechanism for packing data of different types. A structure is a convenient tool for handling a group of logically related data items. Structures can store heterogeneous data types to represent real-life entities. Structures helps to organize complex data in a more meaningful way. It is a powerful concept that we may often need to use in our program design.

- The general format of a structure definition is as follows:

struct  tag_name <br>
{<br>
&nbsp;    data_type   member1;
&nbsp;    data_type   member2;
&nbsp;    ---------   -------
&nbsp;    ---------   ------- <br>
};
